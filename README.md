## ðŸ’¡ About the Project

- Built using **raw SQL queries** in Django to interact with a custom MySQL schema.
- Django ORM was intentionally **not used** for core database operations, allowing full manual control over SQL.
- Integrated with Django's core tables like `auth_user` for authentication and `django_session` for session handling.
- MySQL database schema and sample data are included in the `mysql files/` directory.
